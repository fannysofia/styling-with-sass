# styling-with-sass
Sass project with nesting, partials, mixins, extend, pseudo selectors and operators ðŸš€

## Sass variables

Assign a value to a name (starts with $). After that you can refer to that name instead of the value itself.

## Nesting

Avoid repeating same selectors and write style rules inside another.

## Partials

Include snippets of CSS into Sass file. Partial file (starts with _ ) is used by importing with @ rule. 

## Mixins

Reuse groups of CSS declarations and add properties to them.

## Extend

Share CSS properties between selectors. 

## Pseudo selectors

Nest also pseudo elements and pseudo classes.

## Operators

Do some math in CSS.
